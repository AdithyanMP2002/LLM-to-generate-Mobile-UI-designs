# Mobile UI Design Generator

## Overview
This project creates a small application to generate mobile UI designs using Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion-based image generation models. It combines **GPT-Neo** for text generation and **Stable Diffusion** for image generation to create UI designs based on user-provided textual prompts.

---

## Process Overview

### 1. **Dataset Exploration**
The dataset is sourced from the Hugging Face dataset repository: `mrtoy/mobile-ui-design`.  
It contains mobile UI design images along with their metadata.  
Steps taken:
- Loaded the dataset using the `datasets` library.
- Explored its structure, including column names and sample data.
- Visualized sample images from the dataset.

### 2. **Model Selection**
Two pre-trained models were chosen:
- **GPT-Neo (EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M)**: A causal language model used for generating text-based descriptions of UI designs.
- **Stable Diffusion (CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)**: A diffusion model for generating high-quality images based on text prompts.

### 3. **Model Usage**
- GPT-Neo generates text descriptions for user-provided queries.
- Stable Diffusion takes the text description as input and produces corresponding UI design images.

No fine-tuning was performed; the pre-trained models were used as-is.

### 4. **Application Development**
The application includes:
- **Python-based Script**: A modular script for loading models, generating text, and producing images.
- **Gradio Interface**: A simple web-based UI for user interaction. It accepts a textual prompt and generates corresponding images.

### 5. **Evaluation**
The application was evaluated based on:
- **Output Quality**: Generated images were visually inspected for alignment with textual prompts.
- **Performance**: The application was tested for inference speed and GPU utilization.

## Dependencies
Install the following dependencies to run the application:
```bash
pip install datasets transformers diffusers gradio torch torchvision matplotlib pillow
```

---

## Running the Application
1. Clone the repository or download the script files.
2. Install the dependencies listed above.
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Access the Gradio interface from the link generated in the terminal.
5. Enter a textual description of the desired UI design and adjust parameters like guidance scale and inference steps.

## File Structure
- **app.py**: Main script for the application.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies.
- **README.md**: Documentation (this file).

---

## Limitations
- The generated designs may lack domain-specific accuracy due to the absence of fine-tuning.
- Requires a GPU for efficient inference with Stable Diffusion.

---

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tune GPT-Neo and Stable Diffusion on the specific dataset for better results.
- Add evaluation metrics such as SSIM for quantitative assessment of image quality.
- Enhance the UI for multi-image outputs and batch processing.
